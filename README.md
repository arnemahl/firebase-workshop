## Workshop: [Firebase v3](https://firebase.google.com/)

With Firebase it's easy to make a web-app that communicats with a database and updates in real-time when the content of the database changes. Additionally, it's easy to add authentication, and you can also use Firebase to host web sites. In this workshop we'll go through step by step what you need to do to build a service and make it available to everyone on the internet.

We'll write frontend code in JavaScript, using the frameworks [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) and [Pockito](https://github.com/arnemahl/pockito), but the main focus is on how we easily can use Firebase.

The main features of this workshop are:

* [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/)
* [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/)
* [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/) (this is the main part)
