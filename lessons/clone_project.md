# Clone Project

Now we'll change the frontend code. Since our focus is on Firebase, you can just clone this project into your project directory.
    
1. `$ cd your/project-directory`
2. `$ git clone https://github.com/arnemahl/firebase-workshop.git .`
    * Be sure to add the `.` at the end to clone directly into your project directory
3.  `$ npm install`
